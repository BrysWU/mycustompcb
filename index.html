                    <p>The board outline should be a watertight purple outline showing at least the edge of the board with no gaps.</p>
                    <p>We will cut non-rectangular board shapes, but you will be billed for the smallest rectangle that will encompass the design. As an example, a 2in diameter circle is billed the same as a 2in by 2in square.</p>
                    <p class="note">Non-plated Board Cutouts can be represented on the board outline layer, with some limitations. Slots are unsupported when indicated on the board outline layer, but usually work. To make slots with full support, use Drill Slots on the drill layer.</p>

                    <p>Drill files should be NC Drill or Excellon format files. Multiple files will be accepted, and merged into one for fabrication.</p>
                    <p>Drill hits that pass through copper will be plated. All other drill hits will be non-plated.</p>
                    <p>Most drill formats are detected and displayed as you'd see on the board. If your drills look incorrect, try exporting with INCH units and either No Zero Suppression or Leading Zero Suppression.</p>
                    <p>Drill slots and "oval" drills included as part of the drill file are supported. Most design tools do this when using the tool's native slot commands. Supported slots will appear on this preview. Note, it's possible to use this supported callout in an unsupported way. See our Cutouts and Slots page for details regarding unsupported applications of slot drill commands.</p>
                    <p>Drills sizes below our minimums will be increased to the minimum size. See the design rules or our drills help page for additional details on drill specs.</p>
                    <p class="note">Additionally, the following are not supported: Overlapping drill hits, Blind or buried vias</p>
